# ecc_vhdl


This VHDL source code includes a set of files describing 
hardware modules for finite field arithmetic in GF(2^m), arithmetic 
for elliptic curve point addition/double and for scalar multiplication.
The VHDL code was written entirely by Miguel Morales-Sandoval 
(morales.sandoval.miguel@gmail.com) from 2004 to 2008 when he was 
an MSc and Ph.D. student at the Computer Science department in INAOE,
Mexico.
At that time, all the source code was simulated, validated, and verified in Xilinx ML403 board. 
The VHDL source code provided here is not maintained since 2008.
It is made available to the community as it is, without 
any responsibility nor any additional support by the author.
